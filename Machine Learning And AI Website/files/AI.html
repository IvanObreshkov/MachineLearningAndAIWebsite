        <h1>What is AI</h1>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines,
            <br>in contrast to the natural intelligence (NI) displayed by humans and other animals.
            <br>In computer science AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents":
            <br>any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving
            its goals.
            <br>Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that
            humans associate with other human minds,
            <br>such as "learning" and "problem solving".
