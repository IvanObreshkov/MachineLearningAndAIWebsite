 <h1>Self driving cars</h1>
 <p>
Waymo is an autonomous car development company and subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.

<br>Google began testing self-driving cars in 2009. 
<br>In May 2018, Waymo announced that it plans to allow everyone in Phoenix, Arizona to request a driverless ride before the end of year.

<br>Alphabet describes Waymo as "a self-driving tech company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to move around".

<br>In 2018, the company placed separate orders for "thousands" of hybrid-drive Pacifica minivans and 20,000 Jaguar I-Pace electric sedans.
<br> The vehicles are intended to help launch ride-hailing services in various cities, enough to accommodate hundreds of thousands of riders each day.
